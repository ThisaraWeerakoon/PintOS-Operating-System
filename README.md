As part of the <b>CS2043 - Operating Systems</b> module, I undertook this project involving the Pintos teaching operating system, which is designed for the 80x86 architecture. Pintos is a simple and small OS, making it ideal for educational purposes. Despite its simplicity, it supports essential OS concepts such as kernel threads, virtual memory, user programs, and file systems. However, its initial implementations are often incomplete or premature, so what I did was strengthen those already provided systems. I did it in two steps.

List of `PintOS Operating System` categories mentioned below

## Step 1 : Implementing the Thread System

In this segment of the project, I was provided with a minimally functional thread system. My task was to extend this system's functionality to gain a deeper understanding of synchronization problems. The primary focus was on the **threads** directory, with some additional work in the **devices** directory. Compilation of the project was carried out within the **threads** directory.

To achieve this, I utilized various synchronization techniques, including **semaphores**, **locks**, **monitors**, and **interrupt handling**. These techniques were essential in managing concurrency and ensuring that threads operated correctly without conflicts or data inconsistencies.

The following table contains the list of functions the shell should support
alongside with a brief description of what they are supposed to do.
